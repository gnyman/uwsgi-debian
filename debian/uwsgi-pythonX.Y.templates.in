Description: Migrate configuration files to @@uwsgi_python_binary@@?
 Package @@uwsgi_pythonX.Y_binary@@ has been replaced with @@uwsgi_python_binary@@. This
 transition has been made to the advantage of building Debian and Ubuntu
 packages from one unified source and easing job of Debian Python Team.
 @@uwsgi_python_binary@@ package provides the same functionality as @@uwsgi_pythonX.Y_binary@@,
 but there is one notable important difference between them: placement of
 directories with service files (including configurations, pidfiles, sockets,
 logs) has been changed to mirror naming scheme of new package.
 .
 Configuration files now should be placed in configuration directory
 '/etc/@@uwsgi_python_binary@@/apps-enabled'. @@uwsgi_python_binary@@ package also
 introducing staging directory '/etc/@@uwsgi_python_binary@@/apps-available' which
 could be (and should be) used for placing real configuration files (with
 creating symlinks to them in apps-enabled directory).
 .
 If you answer positively to this question, configuration files of
 @@uwsgi_pythonX.Y_binary@@ (those with xml/ini/yaml/yml extensions) will be copied
 from '/etc/uwsgi/@@uwsgi_pythonX.Y_binary@@' to '/etc/@@uwsgi_python_binary@@/apps-available'
 and symlinks to them will be created in '/etc/@@uwsgi_python_binary@@/apps-enabled'.
 .
 If you answer negatively, then you should copy these files manually.
